// TUI module - placeholder for now
// In a full implementation, this would use ratatui to show:
// - Current work status
// - Progress bar
// - Stats about completed work
// - Best genomes discovered

// For now, we're using logging which is sufficient
// The TUI would be added in a future enhancement
